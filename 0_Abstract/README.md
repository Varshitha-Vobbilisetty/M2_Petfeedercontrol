# Abstract

Our project is designed to help all the pet owners to feed their pets remotely and smartly using microcontrollers. 
Owner will be able to feed the correct amount of food to their pets using a phone app which will be transferred to PCB via Bluetooth which send signals to dispensing gates. 
They will be able to monitor their pet's health condition via daily consumption of food recorded by the app.Sensors will be embedded on the food plate.
Owners with two different types of animal will use RFID tag. 
This RFID tag identifies the type of animal , correct angle of food plate will be spinned so that the corresponding food will be exposed.
