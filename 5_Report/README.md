# Abstract 

Our project is designed to help all the pet owners to feed their pets remotely and smartly using microcontrollers. Owner will be able to feed the correct amount of food to their pets using a phone app which will be transferred to PCB via Bluetooth which send signals to dispensing gates. They will be able to monitor their pet's health condition via daily consumption of food recorded by the app.Sensors will be embedded on the food plate. Owners with two different types of animal will use RFID tag. This RFID tag identifies the type of animal , correct angle of food plate will be spinned so that the corresponding food will be exposed.


# Introduction 

Different sensors are used for the automatic pet feeder so that it works efficiently. A distance sensor or a proximity sensor will be connected to the arduino and as the pet is sensed in the vicinity of the pet feeder, the food from the bottle will be poured in the bowl. Whenever the distance sensor senses motion at a particular distance from the pet feeder i.e. as the pet comes closer to the bowl, the food is served. A servo motor will be used for the locking system. It will be similar to the locking system controlled by angle. All these components will together determine an efficiently running automatic pet feeder.


# Applications

You can schedule meals in advance.

They can be used for dry and wet food.

They will improve good relation with ur pets.

They support good health.

Many of them are battery- operated.
