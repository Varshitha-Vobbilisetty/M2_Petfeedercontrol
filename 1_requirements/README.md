# Introduction
Different sensors are used for the automatic pet feeder so that it works efficiently.
A distance sensor or a proximity sensor will be connected to the arduino and as the pet is sensed in the vicinity of the pet feeder, the food from the bottle will be poured in the bowl.
Whenever the distance sensor senses motion at a particular distance from the pet feeder i.e. as the pet comes closer to the bowl, the food is served. A servo motor will be used for the locking system. 
It will be similar to the locking system controlled by angle. All these components will together determine an efficiently running automatic pet feeder.
